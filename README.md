# AtliQ Grands Hospitality Dashboard
This repository contains a Power BI dashboard for AtliQ Grands, a luxury hotel chain in India. The dashboard provides actionable insights into the performance of AtliQ's properties across various cities, helping the management make data-driven decisions to regain market share and revenue in the competitive luxury and business hotel industry.

## Objective:
To analyze the revenue performance of AtliQ Grands across its luxury and business hotel segments. Through a Power BI dashboard, management can gain insights into key revenue drivers, optimize pricing, and improve occupancy rates, enabling data-driven decisions to strengthen their competitive position and increase profitability.

## Visualizations
**Filter by City & Week:** Allows the user to filter data based on specific cities (Bangalore, Delhi, Hyderabad, Mumbai) and week numbers. This helps in analyzing city-specific performance and trends over time.

**Revenue Card:** Displays total revenue generated, giving a quick snapshot of overall financial performance. Tracking revenue across weeks and cities provides insights into high-performing locations and peak times, helping with targeted marketing and promotions.

**DSRN (Daily Service Requests - New):** Shows the total number of daily service requests. High service requests may indicate demand levels and guest engagement, which can be used to enhance service offerings and improve customer satisfaction.

**Occupancy Card:** Displays the occupancy rate, showing the percentage of rooms occupied. This metric is essential for assessing hotel capacity utilization and identifying opportunities to improve booking strategies.

**ADR (Average Daily Rate):** Shows the average revenue earned per occupied room, helping to evaluate room pricing strategies. A high ADR indicates successful revenue generation from room bookings, while low ADR might signal a need to adjust pricing.

**Booking % by Room Class:** A pie chart that visualizes the distribution of bookings across different room classes (Elite, Standard, Premium). This helps in identifying the popularity of each room class and enables strategic pricing for each segment.

**Revenue by Category:** A donut chart showing revenue distribution across hotel categories (e.g., Luxury and Business). It provides insights into which segments are driving the most revenue, guiding resource allocation and marketing focus.

**Trends by Key Metrics (RevPAR, ADR, Occupancy %):** A line chart displaying trends in key metrics over time. This enables the team to track performance changes across weeks and quickly identify dips or spikes in revenue-related metrics for further investigation.

**Realization % and ADR by Booking Platform:** A bar and line chart combo that shows realization percentage and ADR by booking platform (e.g., website, direct booking, third-party apps). This helps identify the most effective booking channels, aiding in budget allocation for platform-specific marketing.

**Detailed Table (Property, Revenue, RevPAR, Occupancy %, ADR, DSRN, Cancellation %, etc.):** A detailed table providing an in-depth view of each propertyâ€™s performance across various metrics. This granular data enables property-specific analysis, allowing management to pinpoint areas needing improvement or specific properties that are excelling.
